Quixel AB - Megascans Project
The Megascans Integration for Custom Exports was written in Python Version 2.7.15

Megascans : https://megascans.se

This integration gives you a LiveLink between Megascans Bridge and Custom Exports. The source code is all exposed
and documented for you to use it as you wish (within the Megascans EULA limits, that is).
We provide a set of useful functions for importing json data from Bridge.

We've tried to document the code as much as we could, so if you're having any issues
please send me an email (ajwad@quixel.se) for support.

ms_Init is the main function used to call the modules we might be in need of during the plugin's execution.

ms_read_data is an exampel method that demonstrates how you the data can be retrieved.
